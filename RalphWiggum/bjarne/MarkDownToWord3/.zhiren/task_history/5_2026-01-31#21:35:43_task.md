TASK: [from TASKS.md line 57] Add PDF generation library dependency → Add iText or Apache PDFBox to pom.xml for PDF creation

ACTION: Research and select a PDF generation library (iText vs Apache PDFBox), then add the appropriate Maven dependency to pom.xml for PDF document creation.

EXPECTED_OUTCOME:
- PDF generation library dependency added to pom.xml
- Library is compatible with Java 17 and existing dependencies
- Dependency compiles successfully with mvn clean compile
- Library documentation available for implementation in subsequent tasks

EXISTING_CODE:
- pom.xml has flexmark-all (0.64.8) for Markdown parsing
- pom.xml has poi-ooxml (5.2.5) for Word generation
- pom.xml has junit-jupiter (5.10.1) for testing
- WordGenerator.java demonstrates document generation pattern (traverse AST, create output)
- Main.java orchestrates parsing and generation workflow
- Project uses Java 17 (maven.compiler.source/target: 17)

PATTERNS:
- Maven dependencies are declared in <dependencies> section of pom.xml
- Dependencies follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Existing libraries use stable versions (not SNAPSHOT or beta)
- Dependencies are scoped appropriately (compile, test, etc.)
- Maven coordinates follow: groupId:artifactId:version pattern

PLAN:
1. Research PDF library options:
   a. Apache PDFBox (org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox)
      - Pros: Open source (Apache 2.0 license), actively maintained, pure Java, comprehensive PDF features
      - Cons: Can be verbose for complex layouts
      - Latest stable: 2.0.x or 3.0.x (check for Java 17 compatibility)

   b. iText (com.itextpdf:itext-core or com.itextpdf:kernel)
      - Pros: Mature, rich feature set, good documentation
      - Cons: AGPL license (commercial license required for production), more complex
      - Version: Check latest iText 7 or iText 8 for Java 17 compatibility

2. Select library based on:
   - License compatibility (prefer open source for this project)
   - Java 17 support
   - Ease of integration with existing codebase
   - Community support and documentation

3. Add dependency to pom.xml:
   - Add <dependency> section in <dependencies>
   - Use appropriate groupId, artifactId, version
   - Document reason for selection in comments

4. Verify dependency:
   - Run mvn clean compile to ensure dependency downloads and compiles
   - Check for conflicts with existing dependencies
   - Verify library is available in classpath

FILES_TO_CREATE:
- None (modifying existing pom.xml)

FILES_TO_MODIFY:
- MarkDownToWordSource/pom.xml (add PDF library dependency)

TEST_COMMAND:
mvn clean compile

OUTCOME_VERIFICATION:
- Dependency added to pom.xml: grep -E "pdfbox|itext" MarkDownToWordSource/pom.xml shows dependency entry
- Compiles successfully: mvn clean compile exit code 0
- No dependency conflicts: mvn dependency:tree shows pdf library without conflicts
- Library accessible: Can import PDF library classes in Java code

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Apache PDFBox 2.0.x requires Java 8+, should work with Java 17
- Apache PDFBox 3.0.x requires Java 11+, better for modern Java
- iText 7+ requires Java 8+, but has AGPL licensing implications
- Verify license compatibility with project goals (open source preferred)
- Check transitive dependencies don't conflict with Apache POI or flexmark
- Consider using pdfbox-tools or pdfbox-debug for additional utilities if needed
