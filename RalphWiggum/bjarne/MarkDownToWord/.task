TASK: Build final JAR artifact → JAR file exists in target directory with all dependencies
ACTION: Run Maven build command to create executable JAR with all dependencies packaged
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: MarkDownToWord-1.0.jar exists in target directory and can be executed as a standalone application

EXISTING_CODE:
- MarkDownToWordSource/pom.xml - Already configured with maven-shade-plugin for creating fat JAR with Main-Class manifest

PATTERNS:
- Use `mvn clean package` for building (defined in CONTEXT.md)
- Maven shade plugin will create executable JAR at MarkDownToWord-1.0.jar

PLAN:
1. Navigate to MarkDownToWordSource directory
2. Run `mvn clean package` to build the project
3. Verify MarkDownToWord-1.0.jar exists in target directory
4. Verify JAR is executable (contains Main-Class manifest)

FILES_TO_CREATE: []
FILES_TO_MODIFY: []
TEST_COMMAND: cd MarkDownToWordSource && mvn clean package

OUTCOME_VERIFICATION:
- ls -la MarkDownToWordSource/target/MarkDownToWord-1.0.jar shows file exists
- java -jar MarkDownToWordSource/target/MarkDownToWord-1.0.jar runs without error (shows usage)
- JAR file size should be > 5MB (contains all dependencies like POI and Flexmark)
